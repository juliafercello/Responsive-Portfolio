                <p>I am an imaginative, resourceful and strategic problem-solver looking to get back to my roots as a
                    software engineer.
                    For the past 12 years, I have been a product owner / principal business analyst supporting
                    agile teams as the conduit between the team and our customers.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I love to read, watch rom-coms and be crafty through knitting or quilting. I also
                    enjoy listening to music - everything from hiphop to country to grunge. I love to be outside and am
                    an avid fisherperson. Fun fact: I hold the
                    Annual Father and Son Fishing Trip Record for the largest walleye. </p>
                <p>My other full-time job and joy is to be mom to my
                    kiddos and puppy. I have a daughter, Anita, who is 6 and a son, Rudy, who is 2. My dog, Belley Sue,
                    is
                    a black and tan coonhound/lab mix and she is about 15!</p>
